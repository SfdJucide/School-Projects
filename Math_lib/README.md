## MATH Library
Implementation of my own version of the math.h library.

### Overview of my "math.h" functions

|  | Function | Description |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | `int abs(int x)` | computes absolute value of an integer value |
| 2 | `long double acos(double x)` | computes arc cosine |
| 3 | `long double asin(double x)` | computes arc sine |
| 4 | `long double atan(double x)` | computes arc tangent |
| 5 | `long double ceil(double x)` | returns the nearest integer not less than the given value |
| 6 | `long double cos(double x)` | computes cosine |
| 7 | `long double exp(double x)` | returns e raised to the given power |
| 8 | `long double fabs(double x)` | computes absolute value of a floating-point value |
| 9 | `long double floor(double x)` | returns the nearest integer not greater than the given value |
| 10 | `long double fmod(double x, double y)` | remainder of the floating-point division operation |
| 11 | `long double log(double x)` | computes natural logarithm |
| 12 | `long double pow(double base, double exp)` | raises a number to the given power |
| 13 | `long double sin(double x)` | computes sine |
| 14 | `long double sqrt(double x)` | computes square root |
| 15 | `long double tan(double x)` | computes tangent |  

### How to use

To compile the project as static library run `make`, now this can be used in other programs as simple libary.

To run math tests with check.h run (you need to install check.h before this step)

`make test`

There are a lot of tests for each function, even with **inf** and **NaN** cases.
